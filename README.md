# HIV1-Capsid

The interaction between HIV-1 capsid (CA) and host nucleoporin 153 (Nup153) is important for the delivery of the preintegration complex into the nucleus via the nuclear pore complex. The interaction with CA requires a Phenylalanine-glycine (FG) motif in the C-terminal domain of Nup153 (Nup153C). In this study, we modeled this interaction based on the known co-crystal structure of a Nup153 16-mer peptide and an HIV-1 capsid hexamer. Molecular modeling methods utilizing PyRosetta or molecular dynamics with FoldX were used to calculate the free energies of binding to infer residues in Nup153 that were most important for CA interaction. These computational predictions were experimentally validated by testing the interaction of mutant Nup153 with CA to identify a minimal motif for CA interaction.
